This directory houses all the other Operating Systems projects so that they are
all in one place. This allows me to keep these project repos in my github even
if the organization removes them.

### Project 1:
A simple shell that has several built-in commands as well as implementation to
call outside programs that are within the `/bin/` directory.

### Project 2:
A `top` clone that reads through all of the files in `/proc/` and outputs the
corresponding information.

### Project 3:
An event-driven CPU scheduler simulator that implements several different
scheduling algorithms.

### Project 4:
A page-style memory simulator that simulates accessing memory from a process'
frame and bringing it into the page table.
